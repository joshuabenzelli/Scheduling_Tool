# Scheduling_Tool

In this work day scheduling task, we were asked to create a planner that indicated the date, what hour of the day it was, and what items needed to be completed by what time. The colors of the planner are 'gray' if the hour has passed, 'red' for the present hour, and 'green' for future hours. The 'items' that can be inputed into these boxes are for the user to enter their own elements, and then press a save button at the end of each input to save their info to local storage.

I had difficulty getting the local storage object to render back into the HTML, and it is in fact still inoperable. I need to do some more playing with it and research other ways to get the local storage to post to the HTML. I tried the JSON 'stringify' and 'parse' elements at first and was unsuccessful in getting the information to render.

In the future, I could clean up the UI to be prettier and fix the local storage issues, but I figured i'd get some suggestions before delving back into this particular project.

Here's what the project should look like:

![Image1](./Work%20Day%20Scheduler%20-%20Google%20Chrome%205_22_2022%209_55_45%20PM.png)

![Image2](./Work%20Day%20Scheduler%20-%20Google%20Chrome%205_22_2022%209_56_20%20PM.png)

The colors will change when looking at the site at any point between 7am and 6pm.
